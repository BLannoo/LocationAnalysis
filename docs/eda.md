# Exploratory data analysis

## 2019-02-07-find-dense-areas.ipynb
1) Q: Can we recognize some patterns from plotting all the data in a heath map?
    * A: Yes, we see many of the main Belgian roads and cities
2) Can we show the places with the highest density in a recognizable way?
    * A: Yes, by showing those data points, overlaying a map of the nearby Belgian roads.
    * A: Yes, places show up like: 
        * Ensure, Maisuradze, Eddie, Saman, Bankstraat, Vincent, Leuven marked (crossing of many paths?), Kunlabora, Alfred Delaunoislaan, Cegeka
    * A: we can also show them on a Belgian scale

1) Q: Is it possible to use K-means to find hotspots?
    * A: Maybe, but K-means would also show paths with no nearby hotspots as being centroids. (not obvious from notebook)
